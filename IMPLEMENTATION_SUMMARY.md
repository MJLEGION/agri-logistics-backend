# 🚀 Backend Implementation Summary

**Date**: 2024  
**Status**: ✅ All Critical Gaps Fixed  
**Server Status**: ✅ Running on Port 5000

---

## 📋 What Was Implemented

### 🔴 CRITICAL FIX #1: Token Refresh Endpoint ✅

**Problem**: Frontend gets stuck when access token expires (1 hour)

**Solution Implemented**:

- ✅ Updated `generateAccessToken()` to include `userId` and `role` in JWT payload
- ✅ Updated `generateRefreshToken()` to use `userId` instead of `id`
- ✅ Updated `/api/auth/refresh` endpoint to return new tokens + user data
- ✅ Response format: `{ success, token, refreshToken, user }`

**Files Changed**:

- `src/controllers/authController.js` - Token generation & refresh logic
- `src/routes/authRoutes.js` - Route registration (already existed)

**Test Command**:

```bash
POST /api/auth/refresh
Body: { "refreshToken": "..." }
Response: { success: true, token: "...", refreshToken: "...", user: {...} }
```

---

### 🔴 CRITICAL FIX #2: JWT Includes Role ✅

**Problem**: JWT only had `id`, missing `role` for permission checks

**Solution Implemented**:

- ✅ Access token now includes: `{ userId, role }`
- ✅ Auth middleware extracts both: `req.userId` and `req.userRole`
- ✅ All controllers now use `req.userId` for consistency
- ✅ Added `authorize(...roles)` middleware for role-based access control

**Files Changed**:

- `src/middleware/auth.js` - Added `req.userId`, `req.userRole`, and `authorize()` function
- `src/controllers/authController.js` - Updated token generation
- `src/controllers/cropController.js` - Use `req.userId` instead of `req.user._id`
- `src/controllers/orderController.js` - Use `req.userId` and `req.userRole`

**Feature**:

```javascript
// Now you can protect endpoints by role
router.post("/crops", protect, authorize("farmer"), createCrop);
router.post("/orders", protect, authorize("buyer"), createOrder);
router.put(
  "/orders/:id/accept",
  protect,
  authorize("transporter"),
  acceptOrder
);
```

---

### 🔴 CRITICAL FIX #3: Smart Order Filtering ✅

**Problem**: `/api/orders/my-orders` endpoint wasn't properly filtering by role

**Solution Implemented**:

- ✅ Endpoint now filters based on user role:
  - **Farmer**: See orders for their crops (`farmerId = userId`)
  - **Buyer**: See orders they placed (`buyerId = userId`)
  - **Transporter**: See orders assigned to them (`transporterId = userId`)
- ✅ Returns populated order data with user details
- ✅ Sorted by creation date (newest first)

**Files Changed**:

- `src/controllers/orderController.js` - Improved `getMyOrders()` logic
- `src/routes/orderRoutes.js` - Moved route before `:id` to prevent conflicts

**Test It**:

```bash
GET /api/orders/my-orders
Headers: Authorization: Bearer <token>

Response: {
  "success": true,
  "data": [
    {
      "_id": "...",
      "cropId": {...},
      "farmerId": {...},
      "buyerId": {...},
      "transporterId": {...},
      "status": "pending"
    }
  ]
}
```

### 🟡 HIGH PRIORITY FIX #4: Role-Based Endpoint Protection ✅

**What Was Fixed**:

- ✅ Crop endpoints now require `farmer` role
- ✅ Order endpoints now require proper roles:
  - POST /orders: `buyer` only
  - PUT /orders/:id/accept: `transporter` only
- ✅ All endpoints require authentication via `protect` middleware

**Files Changed**:

- `src/routes/cropRoutes.js` - Added `authorize('farmer')` to POST, PUT, DELETE
- `src/routes/orderRoutes.js` - Added role checks for buyer/transporter actions
- `src/middleware/auth.js` - Created `authorize()` middleware

**Example**:

```javascript
// Farmer trying to create order = 403 Forbidden
// Buyer trying to accept order = 403 Forbidden
// Everyone without token = 401 Unauthorized
```

---

### 🟡 HIGH PRIORITY FIX #5: Order Accept Endpoint ✅

**Problem**: Transporters couldn't accept orders

**Solution Implemented**:

- ✅ `PUT /api/orders/:id/accept` endpoint
- ✅ Only transporters can accept (enforced by middleware)
- ✅ Sets `transporterId` and marks order as `in_progress`
- ✅ Also updates crop status to `matched`
- ✅ Prevents double-assignment (check if already has transporter)

**Files Changed**:

- `src/controllers/orderController.js` - Already implemented, fixed to use `req.userId`
- `src/routes/orderRoutes.js` - Added `authorize('transporter')` middleware

**Test It**:

```bash
PUT /api/orders/123/accept
Headers: Authorization: Bearer <transporter_token>

Response: {
  "success": true,
  "data": { order details with transporterId set },
  "message": "Order accepted successfully"
}
```

---

### 🟡 HIGH PRIORITY FIX #6: Payment Mock Endpoints ✅

**Note**: Since you don't have Flutterwave live keys, these are mock endpoints for demo

**What Was Created**:

- ✅ `POST /api/payments/flutterwave/initiate` - Start payment
- ✅ `GET /api/payments/flutterwave/status/:referenceId` - Check status
- ✅ `POST /api/payments/flutterwave/verify` - Verify payment
- ✅ Auto-completes payment after 3 seconds (for demo)
- ✅ Stores transactions in MongoDB

**Files Created**:

- `src/controllers/paymentController.js` - Mock payment logic
- `src/models/transaction.js` - Transaction storage schema
- `src/routes/paymentRoutes.js` - Payment routes
- Updated `.env` - Flutterwave config (test keys)
- Updated `src/server.js` - Registered payment routes

**Test It**:

```bash
# 1. Initiate payment
POST /api/payments/flutterwave/initiate
Body: {
  "amount": 50000,
  "phoneNumber": "+250788123456",
  "orderId": "ORD_123",
  "email": "buyer@example.com",
  "firstName": "John",
  "lastName": "Doe",
  "paymentMethod": "momo"
}

# 2. Check status every 5 seconds (frontend does this)
GET /api/payments/flutterwave/status/FW_ORD_123_...

# After 3 seconds: status changes to "completed"
```

**When You Get Real Flutterwave Keys**:

1. Update `.env`:
   ```
   FLUTTERWAVE_SECRET_KEY=sk_live_xxxxx
   FLUTTERWAVE_API_URL=https://api.flutterwave.com/v3
   ```
2. Replace mock logic in `paymentController.js` with real Flutterwave API calls
3. See the guide: `FLUTTERWAVE_INTEGRATION.md` (in frontend repo)

## 📊 Updated Response Format

All endpoints now return consistent format:

**Success Response**:

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    /* actual data */
  },
  "message": "Optional success message"
}
```

**Error Response**:

```json
{
  "success": false,
  "message": "Error description"
}
```

---

## 🔐 Authentication Flow (Updated)

### 1. **User Registers/Logs In**

```javascript
POST / api / auth / register;
POST / api / auth / login;
// Returns: { token, refreshToken, user: { _id, name, phone, role } }
```

### 2. **Frontend Stores Tokens**

```javascript
localStorage.setItem("token", response.token);
localStorage.setItem("refreshToken", response.refreshToken);
```

### 3. **Frontend Sends Requests**

```javascript
headers: {
  'Authorization': `Bearer ${token}`,
  'Content-Type': 'application/json'
}
```

### 4. **Token Expires (After 1 Hour)**

```javascript
// If 401 received, frontend calls:
POST / api / auth / refresh;
Body: {
  refreshToken;
}
// Gets new tokens valid for another hour
```

---

## 🧪 Quick Testing Checklist

- [ ] **Auth**:

  ```bash
  POST /api/auth/register → Get token + refreshToken
  POST /api/auth/login → Get token + refreshToken
  POST /api/auth/refresh → Get new tokens
  GET /api/auth/me → Get current user
  ```

- [ ] **Crops**:

  ```bash
  GET /api/crops → All crops (any authenticated user)
  POST /api/crops → Create (farmer only)
  PUT /api/crops/:id → Update (farmer who owns crop)
  DELETE /api/crops/:id → Delete (farmer who owns crop)
  ```

- [ ] **Orders**:

  ```bash
  GET /api/orders/my-orders → Filtered by role (working!)
  POST /api/orders → Create (buyer only)
  PUT /api/orders/:id/accept → Accept (transporter only)
  ```

- [ ] **Payments** (Mock):
  ```bash
  POST /api/payments/flutterwave/initiate → Start payment
  GET /api/payments/flutterwave/status/:ref → Check status
  POST /api/payments/flutterwave/verify → Verify
  ```

- Payment endpoints use mock (auto-completes after 3 seconds)
- Perfect for frontend testing without real payments

### **For Production** (When you get Flutterwave keys):

1. Get Flutterwave Secret Key (business account or test keys)
2. Update `.env` with real keys
3. Replace mock logic in `paymentController.js` with real API calls
4. Reference: `FLUTTERWAVE_INTEGRATION.md` has the code

### **Additional Improvements** (Optional):

- Add rate limiting on payment endpoints
- Add transaction reconciliation job
- Add webhook handler for payment confirmations
- Implement WebSocket for real-time order updates
- Add analytics/reporting

## 📞 If Something Breaks

### **Error: "Invalid token"**

- User's token expired → Should auto-refresh via refresh endpoint
- Token malformed → Re-login required

### **Error: "Not authorized"**

- User not authenticated → Missing Bearer token
- User not in required role → Wrong role trying to access endpoint

### **Error: "Order not found" on accept**

- Order ID incorrect → Check order exists
- Transporter can't double-accept → Already assigned to someone

### **Error: "Farmer can't create order"**

- Using buyer role trying to create order with farmer route
- Check route authorization middleware
